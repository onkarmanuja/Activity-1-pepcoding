1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:07,700
Now even in its current state our web site already compares pretty favorably with our computer science
1

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,300
professors’ web sites.
2

3
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:11,450
So we're definitely doing something right here.
3

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:18,350
But we can make it even better. If you take a look at the personal website of Sean Halpin, who's a web
4

5
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:21,230
designer at seanhalpin.io,
5

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,850
this is one of the most beautiful personal websites I've ever come across.
6

7
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:31,620
It's incredibly simple but it's also really beautiful and really well-designed.
7

8
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:36,500
So this is going to be our inspiration for this CSS module.
8

9
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,660
And I'm going to show you how,
9

10
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:44,810
by using the powers of CSS and everything that you're going to learn in this module, we're going to elevate
10

11
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:52,830
the design of our personal site to look something like this and bring it right into the 21st century.
11

12
00:00:52,850 --> 00:01:00,140
So the first thing that would already make our web site look a little bit nicer is changing this pretty
12

13
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:04,850
bland white background to a colored background.
13

14
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:12,860
So if you head over to your code file and open up index.html, we can inject a little bit of CSS right
14

15
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:16,280
into the HTML tag that we want to affect.
15

16
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:24,830
And the tag that we're interested in is the body tag, because we know that most, if not all, of our displayed
16

17
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:29,630
content on our web site is enclosed inside this body tag.
17

18
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:35,950
So if we change its background then the entire web site’s background will change too.
18

19
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:47,360
So inside this body tag we're going to tap into an attribute called style and style takes CSS code inside
19

20
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,690
the quotation marks.
20

21
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:53,210
So the style that we want to change is the background color.
21

22
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:59,050
So I'm going to write background-color, and I'm going to write a colon.
22

23
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:04,450
And after that colon I'm going to specify the color that I want for the body.
23

24
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:12,560
And let's just start off with a blue color and then we're going to close off this line of CSS code using
24

25
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,220
a semicolon.
25

26
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:22,190
And now if I hit save and if I go back to my browser, and remember that we're working with the local
26

27
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:27,620
file, not the one that you might have hosted on GitHub, but this is where our development is going to
27

28
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,190
happen.
28

29
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:34,760
So if you don't have it up, remember you can simply right click and go to Copy Full Path and paste it in
29

30
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,690
here in order to get to that web site under development.
30

31
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:46,820
So once you're here then if you hit refresh you'll see our CSS code being implemented, changing the entire
31

32
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,420
background of our web page.
32

33
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:54,900
Now the question you might have at this stage, beside the question of how did we manage to get our web
33

34
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,500
site looking even uglier than before,
34

35
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,210
just bear with me on that,
35

36
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:06,320
but the question that most students have is ‘Well, how did you know to use background color and how did
36

37
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,820
you know that blue as a color would work?’.
37

38
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:12,240
Let's see how we can find out how to do this.
38

39
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:23,810
So if I head over to Google and we search for ‘change background color using CSS’, and we're going to tag
39

40
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:27,760
on MDN at the end because that's our preferred documentation,
40

41
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:35,300
and you can see that the first link that shows up already takes us to the documentation on the background
41

42
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:42,890
color and this page explains that the background color is a CSS property which sets the background color
42

43
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:44,760
of a particular element.
43

44
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:55,130
So we've used this particular line to change the background color of our body HTML element to
44

45
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:55,850
blue.
45

46
00:03:55,850 --> 00:04:05,000
Now, as it shows, we can also do this using hex values or hexadecimal values, so we can replace this really
46

47
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:13,640
ugly looking blue with something that is custom, and a really good tool for finding beautiful colors
47

48
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:18,320
and beautiful color palettes is a website called colorhunt.co.
48

49
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:25,820
And here you've got professional designers who've curated some of their favorite color palettes and
49

50
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:31,190
they've provided the hex codes to implement them in your own designs.
50

51
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,130
So you can search by hot or popular.
51

52
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,490
And we're going to look for a nice color palette that is going to work for our particular project.
52

53
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:47,240
So I'm going to choose this one and I'm just going to go ahead and copy the hex value of this nice sort
53

54
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:55,490
of light pastel green bluish color and I'm going to replace the word blue with that hex value.
54

55
00:04:55,580 --> 00:05:01,790
And remember whenever you're using hex values it needs to have the pound sign or you might see it as
55

56
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,820
the hashtag sign in front.
56

57
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:11,450
Now as soon as we add that hex code you'll notice that one of our plugins that we installed in the beginning,
57

58
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:19,460
the one called pigments, is highlighting that color to us to show us what it'll look like when it's implemented.
58

59
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,280
But we're going to verify that on our website as well.
59

60
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:29,630
So let's go ahead and hit save and go back to our web site and hit refresh and you can see that beautiful
60

61
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:34,810
light green color is now showing across our web page.
61

62
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:40,880
So the other question that you might have is ‘How can I figure out which colors I can use
62

63
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:46,610
just by specifying the name of it and which ones I have to use as a hex value?’.
63

64
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:53,210
Well again let's head over to Google and we're going to look for an answer to our query.
64

65
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:58,700
And I know that I've been banging on about this point but it's really really important because as a
65

66
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:06,620
fully fledged web developer one of the most important skills is finding and figuring out how to do something
66

67
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:09,270
that is specific to your needs.
67

68
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:16,400
So inevitably at some point in your future career you will need to build features or implement things
68

69
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,560
that we haven't ever talked about.
69

70
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:24,680
And it's important that you really start building up this skill, or figure out what are the best keywords
70

71
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,660
to search for.
71

72
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,700
How do I structure my searches?
72

73
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:35,060
Which sources am I going to go to, be it Google, Stack Overflow, MDN, in order to figure out how I can
73

74
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,670
do this specific thing that I want to do?
74

75
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:43,040
And that's why I want to show you my thought process in order to guide you on how you can start doing
75

76
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,360
this for yourself as well.
76

77
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:50,210
So whenever you come across something that you want to figure out or you want to do that isn't covered
77

78
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:56,960
in the tutorials I want you to first give it a go looking and seeing if you can figure it out for yourself
78

79
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:03,480
because this is one of the most important skills that you need to learn as a developer.
79

80
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:12,080
So let's go ahead and search for CSS colors and if we hit Enter you'll see that Google has picked out
80

81
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:20,040
this particular table on the MDN web site, and it has keywords and RGB hex values.
81

82
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:22,940
So let's go and take a look at it in more detail.
82

83
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:29,620
So this is a page that I recommend you bookmarking even, because it describes the color
83

84
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:33,450
CSS data type that's available to you when you use CSS.
84

85
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:40,760
And if you scroll down there's this really useful table that shows you the colors and the keywords
85

86
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:48,230
that you can use in order to implement these colors in your code without ever having to dive into the
86

87
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,360
hex code.
87

88
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:55,830
So for example maybe you want the background to be this powder blue right.
88

89
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:03,200
So you can go ahead and simply copy this keyword and instead of using the hex code we can simply use
89

90
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:10,880
the word powderblue and if we refresh our web site you can see that that color is automatically rendered
90

91
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:15,280
because it's recognized as a valid CSS color.
91

92
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:19,880
So this is a quick and easy way of implementing colors using CSS.
92

93
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:24,360
Now there's a whole range of other ways that you can change the color using CSS.
93

94
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:30,050
And I'll leave you to read through this documentation and take a look at some of the other ways or some
94

95
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:34,910
of the other palettes that you can tap into. Now, heading back to our personal site,
95

96
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:44,570
the next thing that I want to change is the style of these horizontal rules, and you might realize that
96

97
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:52,340
there's a little bit of difficulty involved in doing this because as nice as it is modifying the style
97

98
00:08:52,460 --> 00:09:00,470
of a particular HTML element by simply going into the tag and changing the style attribute, it's a
98

99
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:05,090
little bit cumbersome when you want to do that to many repeated elements,
99

100
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:10,310
for example our horizontal rules, because I have a total of about four of them,
100

101
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:17,870
and I would have to write up the CSS code and copy and paste into each and every one of these tags.
101

102
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:24,980
Now if at some point I decide to change one of these CSS values, say, you know, I actually prefer this
102

103
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:32,840
light color over this powder blue and I'm going to change it back to that particular hex code then I
103

104
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:37,430
would have to remember to change it in all four places.
104

105
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:39,830
And this is very very error prone.
105

106
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:46,850
So in the next lesson I'm going to show you another way that you can implement CSS code that will apply
106

107
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:49,630
across the entire web page.
107

108
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:55,110
And it's by using internal CSS. You can look forward to that in the next lesson.
108

109
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:55,600
See you then.
